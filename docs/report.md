# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model

Here comes a description of our domain model.

## Architecture â€” In the small

## Architecture of deployed application

----------------------------------------------------
Illustrate the architecture of your deployed application. Remember, you developed a client-server application. Illustrate the server component and to where it is deployed, illustrate a client component, and show how these communicate with each other.
----------------------------------------------------

### Introduction and Architecture
Chirp! is a mini social media platform based around user generated "cheeps", 160 character text-based messages which stores the input of the cheep author's shared message. It is hosted on Azure App Service and utilizes ASP.Net 7.

The project uses the Razor Pages framework to serve Chirp.Web. Chirp.Web effectively sets up the GUI for the website, and is a blend of static html components like images, css, javascript files, and razor pages, all of them collectively handles the user's experience on the Chirp! platform.

The backend of the website is handled by Chirp.Core and Chirp.Infrastructure.
As its innermost layer, Chirp.Core handles the Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)and the interfaces. The DTOs are data carriers, exchanging data related to authors, cheeps, users, follows, and reactions between the different parts of the project.

Chirp.Infrastructure is the persistent data layer of the Chirp! application. This is where models for Author, Cheep, Follows, Reaction, User, and their corresponding repositories exist, handling the actual data operations with the database. It also includes the dbinitializer, which helps manage the database state.

### Client-server communication

The database server is hosted on SQL Server on Azure App Service. The database server works with the Chirp.Infrastructure layer, where it stores and retrieves data as requested by the application.

The communication between the client application and the server is carried out through HTTP and HTTPS protocols (Get, Set, etc..). These protocols are safely handled by the Azure App Service using their TCP/IP service, giving high certainty of reliable data transmissions.

When a user interacts with the Chirp! website, an HTTP request is sent to the server. For instance, when a user posts a new cheep, the client application sends a request to the server to store that information in the database. The server then processes this request with the help of Chirp.Core and Chirp.Infrastructure, which handle data operations with the database. (DIAGRAM)

The server, after storing the cheep in the database, sends a response back to the client application, signifying that the operation was successful and updates accordingly. This kind of request-response communication happens every time a user interacts with the website and uses its functions.

Both the Chirp! application and the SQL Database are hosted on Azure App Service, where the Azure services provide a cloud-based platform for deployment, management, and scalability. Hosting on Azure also ensures greater security, with a free https certificate, automatic scaling, and ease of use for deployment through Github pushes.

Azure Services, used to host Chirp!, utilize ACID properties in their SQL Server, ensuring all-or-nothing transactions for data consistency. Concurrency is managed through SQL Server's locking mechanism and conflict detection in Entity Framework, which is part of the Chirp! application. During a transaction, the accessed data is locked to prevent conflicting modifications. Entity Framework also checks for changes made by other users since the last read, helping to resolve any conflicts. Lastly, data integrity within Chirp! is maintained by enforcing constraints in the SQL Server database.

### User Authentication
User authentication in Chirp! is managed through GitHub's OAuth authentication service. This service enables users to log into the application using their GitHub accounts, providing an easy login experience. (DIAGRAM)

When a user attempts to log in, the application directs them to GitHub's OAuth login page. After the user enters their GitHub credentials and grants the necessary permissions, GitHub sends an authorization code back to the Chirp! application. This authorization code is handled by an ASP.NET handler form in Chirp!, which then exchanges it for an access token.

The access token is a unique string that represents the user's authorization to access their GitHub data. This token is stored securely in the user's session and is used to authenticate subsequent requests made by the user.

By delegating authentication to GitHub, Chirp! can provide a secure and user-friendly login process. It also reduces the risk of storing and managing sensitive user data on the Chirp! server, as the user's password is never directly handled by the application.

### External services
Currently Chirp is using JQuery to enhance Chirp! users with an AJAX script to dynamically load the follow, unfollow, and reaction forms. This ensures better user experience and fewer elements loaded once interacted with.

## Build, test, release, and deployment  
The group employed the use of Github Workflows/Actions to build, test, release and deploy the app to Azure. The UML activity diagrams below show how each of the Workflows work

//TODO: figure out how we want to source from things
Source: [Github choose a license site](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

The group chose this license as it was a good fit for the groups requirements of an open source license in that it basically has no restrictions for any end user or somebody who wants to work with the codebase. We also sign off any warranty or liability which is great for a small group project that we more than likely wont want to take further in the future.

## LLMs, ChatGPT, CoPilot, and others
The use of LLMs like ChatGPT and Copilot has been documented on github commits as a co-author when used. You can see the number of these commits on the page linked here: [ChatGPT Co-authored commits](https://github.com/ITU-BDSA23-GROUP10/Chirp/graphs/contributors). Sadly the page that shows the actual commits doesn't have the commits that it contributed on as these were done on separate branches whose commits seem to not carry over to the main branch's working tree.
