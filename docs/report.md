# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

## Domain model

Here comes a description of our domain model.

## Architecture â€” In the small

## Architecture of deployed application

## User activities

## Sequence of functionality/calls trough _Chirp!_

# Process

## Build, test, release, and deployment  
The group employed the use of Github Workflows/Actions to build, test, release and deploy the app to Azure. The UML activity diagrams below show how each of the Workflows work

//TODO: figure out how we want to source from things
Source: [Github choose a license site](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

The group chose this license as it was a good fit for the groups requirements of an open source license in that it basically has no restrictions for any end user or somebody who wants to work with the codebase. We also sign off any warranty or liability which is great for a small group project that we more than likely wont want to take further in the future.

## LLMs, ChatGPT, CoPilot, and others
The use of LLMs like ChatGPT and Copilot has been documented on github commits as a co-author when used. You can see the number of these commits on the page linked here: [ChatGPT Co-authored commits](https://github.com/ITU-BDSA23-GROUP10/Chirp/graphs/contributors). Sadly the page that shows the actual commits doesn't have the commits that it contributed on as these were done on separate branches whose commits seem to not carry over to the main branch's working tree.
