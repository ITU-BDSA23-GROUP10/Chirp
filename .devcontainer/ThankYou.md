# Huge Thanks to Albert Rise Nielsen and his amazing group for giving me the idea to try dev containers and dockerizing the project
## You can find a link to his groups repo here. The dev container implementation was actually done using Vs codes Dev container extension (ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## so we actually didn't end up using any of their code but it was nice to have a reference to look at before starting this branch.
